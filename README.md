# AOC 2018 Solutions

Written in C (because I hate myself).
They're all naive and not the best solutions, but they work (at least for my inputs..)

Check out [Advent of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/)

### Note
Arrays are created with a fixed size based on the length of the input, because I'm too lazy to realloc them.
If the codes segfault, try checking the lengths.
